        <p class="girlfont" style="font-size: 20px; padding: 25px;">Once upon a time, on an average day... in a hell hole called Mclaren. A blonde sarcastic angel entered my life and everything got so much less shit.
        But as they say, all good things must come to an end. There I was thinking our friendship was impenetrable... but alas, the devil did come and I guess its hard to resist the devil.
        One beautiful sunny day in the south of England, I woke up for another beautiful day of approvals, contract writting and conference calls. It was a day like any other day (except sunny, bit shit tbh); however, little did I know... some bish was about to steal my work wife... LIVID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p class="girlfont" style="font-size: 20px; padding: 25px;">Me and my bestie had a one to one scheduled for the afternoon, however she asked if I still needed it... on this occasion I was busy doing a RIDICULOUS amount of work, set by our slave driving company and thus, we agreed to postpone 'till the end of the day.
         BUT when the time came... SHE DIDN'T ANSWER MY CALL!!!!!!! I sent her multiple instant messages on teams. No reply. I sent her voice messages on whatsapp. Blue ticked. I was close to tears. AND THEN... the truth occured to me.</p>
        <p class="girlfont" style="font-size: 40px; padding: 25px;">SHE HAD BEEN STOLEN BY MY ARCH NEMESIS, KPM!!!!!!!</p>
        <p class="girlfont" style="font-size: 20px; padding: 25px;">It all made sense. At somepoint during my sunny day that had once filled me with hope, the devilish KPM had tempted my work wife into cheating on me, AND SUCCEDED!</p>
        <p class="girlfont" style="font-size: 20px; padding: 25px;">And that is how... I lost... my best friend.</p>
        <p class="girlfont" style="font-size: 20px; padding: 25px;">Thank you for listening to my story, please don't worry... I am now in counsilling. Currently medicated with several anti-depressants, but looking to come off them by Christmas. I really appriciate all of your kind words.</p>
